          <p>&ldquo;Beyond Z had provided me with innumerable opportunities for personal and professional growth, but the Capstone project took our learning experiences beyond that of our own and empowered me to give back to my community. I really appreciated this opportunity, it was a great learning experience in regards to leadership for me as a project manager.&rdquo;</p>
