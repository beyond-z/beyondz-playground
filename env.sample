# if you use foreman to run your development server, these env variables will be picked up automatically.
# otherwise, configure your dev env with the values for these ENV variables.

# This is COMPLETELY INSECURE but the point of the "playground" is to easily have people running code on their dev env
# to play around.  On the real platform, none of these values are here.

# get this from the team or generate one yourself for your dev env using "rake secret"
